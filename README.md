# glide_tech_test
This is my tech test for Glide.

The task was to fetch data from a website and store it in a database using an object orientated approach.
My solution to this problem primarily focuses on the backend, with a minimal front-end to show the results and trigger the script.

If I were to spend more time on this, in addition to the optional additional functionality, I would add pagination to the table, and impliment session data so filters are saved.
